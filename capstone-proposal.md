#### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

##### Allows users to play a RPG baseball game that involves number guessing

#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

##### - User can input a "Swing" number and a "pitch" number. The difference between the two is the outcome of the At-Bat.
##### - Game records runs when they are scored.
##### - Game will switch between teams after three outs are recorded.

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
##### React.

#### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
##### - Create player types (e.g. a "contact hitter" that has better ranges for recording singles, but worse home run ranges.)
##### - Create Teams!
##### - Refine CSS

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
##### - I don't know.

#### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
